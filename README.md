# NLP_Projects
The repository contains code for various Natural Language Processing tasks :

# SpamFilter.py 
This has code for building a spam filter classification model using Naive Bayes on a dataset of spam emails and non-spam emails. The model is used to classify unknown emails, and also find out the most indicative spam and non-spam words/token in the model.

# HMM_Viterbi.py
This has code for developing the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in Python 2.7 for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, using the Brown corpus as training data. The tag set used for this is the universal POS tag set, which is composed of the twelve POS tags. The application is capable of giving the most probable tags for a given sentence through Viterbi Decoding Algorithm

# LanguageModelling_Markov.py
This has code for building a language model based on Markov Models that can be used to generate random text resembling a source document.n-gram models were trained using a corpus of text files and random text generation and perplexity calculation functionalities were incorporated for test data text. This has been accomplished without using any external Python libraries such as NumPy, NLTK etc.
